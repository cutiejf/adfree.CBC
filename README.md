# adfree.CBC
CBC.ca website cleaner: strips ads, comments, popups, widgets, trackers—shows just the article with minimal litter. Fast, distraction-free reading. We already pay them enough to deliver their fake news, last thing they should be doing is profiting via questionable ads while impressioning us. Take a stand. We are one of the only people who fund a state media conglomerate and still see their budget of over a billion not big enough to spare us these nickle and dime earning eyesores.
